\section{Problem}

Let there be $k$ types of values, $n=(n_1, ..., n_k)$ values, which are assumed to be distinct and $m$ \textit{slots} which may be optional and associated with a penalty. 
Each value and each slot are of exactly one type.
A set of constraints may apply that either limit the set of possible solutions or impose a penalty on solutions violating them.
The problem considered here consists of finding an assignment of a value to each slot so that both the type requirement and any additional hard constraint is satisfied and the cost incurred by violated soft constraints is minimized.

%- What kinds of problems can be modeled with this?

%This model can describe any problem that can be 
%- discrete, finite components
%- problem of finding assignments of 
%CANNOT:
%- infinite domains (possible with smt)
%- unspecified components
%- relationships between components of different types
