Let $t_i$ denote the $k$ component types, $c_{\text{,}}$ the components of each type. Let $C = \{\}$ denote the set of all components.
For all components $c_{k_1}, ..., c_{k_n}$ of each of the $k$ sorts it must be specified that the component variables are distinct. 
Every component slot in an assignment corresponds to one decision variable. Let $x_{a\text{,}s}$ denote these decision variables. 
Let $\mathcal{M}: x_{a\text{,}s} \rightarrow c_i$ denote the model assignment from each assignment slot variable to exactly one component.
