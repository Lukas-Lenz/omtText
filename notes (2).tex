  - group?	-> processed by lib?
- all components are distinct!

	- optional
	- weight
	- component slots:
		- type			-> slot variable
		- optional		-> ???
		- fixed, component -> slot variable equality
		
- extension: number

- rule
	- std::shared_ptr<Condition<ID>> toplevel;
	- bool restrictedSet;
    - std::vector<std::vector<Assignment<ID>*>> applicableSets;
    - optional, weight
