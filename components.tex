\subsection{Components}
Let $\mathbb{T}$ denote an arbitrary time unit and $\mathbb{B}=\{True, False\}$. Every component class is derived from the same base class, determining that all components can be assumed to have a unique ID to identify it to the calling program, tags and groups.

\subsubsection*{Conditions}
Let $c, c'$ denote component specifications and $c_i, c'_j, 1\leq i \leq cardinality_c, 1\leq j\leq cardinality_{c'}$ the corresponding component variable(s).
General conditions:
\begin{description}
\item[Component.inGroup(g)]
$$\bigwedge_{c_i} group_{i,g}$$

\item[Component.inSet(set)]
$$\bigwedge_{c_i}\bigvee_{s_j\in set} c_i = s_j$$

\item[Component.tag(tag) <, <=, >, >=, =, != Int]
Tags are similar to groups, but while groups denote a binary inclusion/exclusion relation, tags take values in $\mathbb{N}_0$ and can express attributes with varying degrees of applicability.

\item[$c==c', c!=c'$]
$$ (i = j) \wedge \bigwedge_i c_i = c'_i $$

\item[Boolean combinations of conditions]
$$\neg, \wedge, \vee \rightarrow$$

\item[(Time and derived) $operator<(c1, c2)$ (and $<=, >, >=$)]
A1.Component <, <=, >, >= A2.Component
$$ start_1 < start_2 $$
\item[(Time and derived) ImmediateSuccessor]
\item[(Time and derived) ImmediatePredecessor]
\item[(Timeslots and derived) Overlap]
\item[(Timeslots and derived) Within]
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Ordering}
Some rules require an ordering on assignments.
On some components (e.g. time), an order can be defined quite naturally.
