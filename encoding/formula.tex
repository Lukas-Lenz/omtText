from decision procedures:

6.1.1 Syntax
The subset of bit-vector arithmetic that we consider is deﬁned by the following grammar: 

%formula : formula ∧formula |¬formula | (formula ) | atom 

atom : term rel term | Boolean-Identiﬁer | term[constant ] 

rel : < | = 

%term : term op term | identiﬁer | ∼ term | constant | atom?term:term | %term[constant : constant ] | ext(term ) 

%op : + | − | · | / | << | >> | & | | | ⊕ |◦ 

---

We only need the subset of this that is actually used.
Really, all that is needed is a type, 

SyntacticObject class?
