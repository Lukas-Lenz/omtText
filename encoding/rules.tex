\subsection{Rules}
Rules define constraints between assignments.


SameTime(A1, A2) => A1.Component("Nurse") != A2.Component("Nurse")

"SameTime(A1, A2)" "=>" "A1.Component("Nurse")" "!=" "A2.Component("Nurse")"

|SameTime(A1, A2)| |=>| |A1.Component("Nurse")| |!=| |A2.Component("Nurse")|
bool			op			obj				 op			obj


bool !=(obj, obj)
bool =(obj, obj)

bool =>(bool, bool)

bool SameTime(Ass, Ass)

objct Component()

A rule is a function taking either 2 or n assignments, returning bool

i want to save parts recursively

every function part of a function needs to depend on assignments

LEFT OPERATOR RIGHT

Left and right can be functions or rules

the rule object provides a function for 


rule		:= expression op expression
expression	:= function | rule

Formula: wrapper class for some proper formula
or: function to invoke for every translatable unit
