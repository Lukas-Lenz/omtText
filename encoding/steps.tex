information that needs to be kept: assignment between external and internal ID

elements might be added to groups after group-wide constraints are created

- When a create constraint is called, create a constraint object

- Go through all constraint objects and call generate on them all
- Create component objects and constraint objects
- generate constraints

-

\begin{enumerate}
\item create a problem object with a name/id
\item create a class for each type of component (can use using)
\item create a class for each type of assignment (must derive, is abstract)
\item create groups and tags
\item create components, with appropriate groups and tags
\item 
\end{enumerate}
