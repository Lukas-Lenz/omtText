\subsection{Modelling the ITC2021 Problem}

Phased or unphased!

"In this competition we only consider time-constrained double round-robin tournaments with even numbers of teams" (each team plays exactly one game per timeslot)

time-constrained/compact: uses the minimal number of time slots needed
otherwise: time-relaxed

timeslots: single timeslot with parallel assignments for multiple games
tasks: team vs. team game

2RR:
- if $(a,b)$ played in the first half, then $(b,a)$ must play in the second round

create a group for each team
create a task for each team x team game
add them to the corresponding 


\subsubsection{Phased}

In \textbf{phased} competitions, the competition is split into intervals in which all combinations of teams compete once.

conjunction of group requirements

one per phase 
problem: determining phase length



\subsubsection{Capacity Constraints}
\begin{description}
\item[CA1:] teams, max, mode: H for home, A for away, slots, type: HARD or SOFT; teams from cannot play more than max games of mode in timeslots slots (in benchmarks teams only ever contains one team - other benchmarks can be expanded into that format)
\item[CA2:] teams1, min, max, mode1: H for home, A for away, HA for both, mode2: GLOBAL ???, teams2: played against teams, slots, type
\item[CA3:] teams1, max, mode1, teams2, intp, mode2, type; 
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Notes reading}

- MetaData can be ignored
- here: only single league with all teams (encoding should accomodate multiple though)
- here: no grouping teams and time slots into time groups (could be achieved easily with groups?)
- RobinX is general format? not from ITC?
- 

\begin{enumerate}
\item create timeslots (only ID and name)
- calculate max possible number of games per timeslot and create that many instances for each (problem: many symmetric assignments?)
\item create a group for each team
\item (league: id, name)
\item (need group for each league for rules?)
\item (team: id, league, name)
\item create group for each team
\item read structure: for each league:
\begin{enumerate}
\item create tasks for each team x team combination in a league, depending on round-robin number, add team groups
\item set compactness rule (???) if applicable
\item set game mode (phased/unphased) rule (???) if applicable
\end{enumerate}
\item The competition instances only use 9 of the possible constraints (these should be implemented here)
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Components}

Slots: 
group: each timeslot has a group with its id

Games:
name: IDteam1\_IDteam2
groups:
\begin{enumerate}
\item group: "H" or "A" for home or away for each time
\item group "HA" for both teams
\item "l" league
\item groups with the id of each team
\end{enumerate}
In total 8 groups per game.


Assignment:
One fixed timeslot, $\lfloor \#games/2\rfloor$ optional game slots


Implicit Rules:
// a team can only play one game simultaneously
\begin{minted}{C++}
for( assignment ){
	itc21.addRule( Unique(gameType) );
\end{minted}

%num components:
%num rules:

rules used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item AssignOnce(component)
	\item Unique(assignment, slotType)
	\item 
\end{itemize}








Rules:

CA1: "teams t each play at most max games of mode m in slots s", can be hard or soft
"each team in temas triggers a deviation equal to the number of mode games in slots more than max"

components: groups (team), timeslots (),
for each team (group):
NumAssigned(InComponent(Timeslots ts...) \& InGroup(Mode, mode)) <= MAX

CA2: "each team in teams1 does not play more than max games of mode m against teams2 during timeslots slots"
for each team in 

NumAssigned(InTimeslots(slots) \& Groups(teams2) \& Group(mode)) <= MAX

CA3: "Each team in teams1 plays at most max games of mode m against teams2 "
For each group in teams1:
???? INTP ????
NumAssigned()

C4: "teams1 play at most max games of mode m against teams2 during time slots slots"

NumAssigned(OR(Group(teams1)) \& OR(Group(teams2)) \& Group(mode) \& In(slots)) <= MAX

GA1: (min max meetings slots type) "fixed and forbidden time slot assignments" "at least min and at most max games from meetings = $\{(i_1,j_1),(i_2,j_2),...\}$ take place in time slots slots"

(if min = max add single equality constraint)

NumAssigned() >= min
NumAssigned() <= max

(Break constraints)

"If a team plays a game with the same home-away status as its previous game, it is called a break"

BR1: (teams intp mode2 slots type)
"Each team in teams has at most intp home/away breaks (H,A,HA) during time slots slots" 

"BR1 constraints with multiple teams can be broken up into one constrant per teams, therefore ITC2021 only has single team constraints"

NumAssigned(InComponent(Timeslot, slots) \& 'prevGame.mode = curGame.mode') <= INTP

Assignment:

One assignment per game

FIXED: game
REQUIRED: time (not exclusive)

same team => not equal times

for each combination of game assignments:
